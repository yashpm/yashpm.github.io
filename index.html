    <div class="About-me">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>A senior at Queen's University majoring in physics, minoring in computing,
         and graduating as of 2021 . Curiousity of how the world works and watching
          physics videos and demonstrations lead me to a Physics major. Through this
           major I've discovered my interets for silicone photonics, cybersecuirty,
            on which I did a thesis on and submitted a conference paper for IEEE IPC
            conference 2020. Along with physics, while attending a tech conference I
             gained the passion to become a programmer with which my interets have
             evolved to software engineering, AI, and web development. Design has
             been another passion of mine and so to the ever growing list of passions,
             design, art, and graphical design have been added.
        </p>
      <p>Interests: Software Engineering, Design, Cybersecuirty, Silicone Photonics , AI, Sketching, Graphic design, Physics   </p>
